                        I'm a passionate web development student at Bow Valley College, set to graduate in May,
                        with a strong foundation in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript. I'm also skilled in C# and .NET,
                        where Iâ€™ve worked on Windows application development using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
                        Proficient with Git and GitHub, I use these tools daily to manage codebases and collaborate effectively.
                        My go-to environments are VS Code and Visual Studio, where I build, debug, and refine high-quality applications.
                        I thrive on solving complex problems, writing clean and efficient code,
                        and continuously expanding my expertise in modern development tools and frameworks.
